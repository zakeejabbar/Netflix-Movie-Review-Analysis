"Netflix Movie Review Analysis"

This project takes in two files one containing movie names, the other containing corresponding review data to those movie names.
The program stores the data into an array of structs, and then sorts the movie data by top 10 movies by rating, and top 10 movies by
number of ratings.

Program can be executed by compiling the main.c file

Ex: 
gcc main.c -o myProg
./myProg
